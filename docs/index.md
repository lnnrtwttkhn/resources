# Resources

## Welcome! :wave:

Welcome to this documentation, maintained by [Lennart Wittkuhn](https://lennartwittkuhn.com/).

This documentation is my personal list of resources (links, code snippets etc.) that I find useful in my everyday work.

!!! info
    Please note that these resources are updated irregularly and information is likely incomplete.
    This page is mainly used as my personal notes list but I chose to make it public so that others might benefit from it as well.
