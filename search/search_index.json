Each cell's activity is shown with a line next to the cell number and a dot on the track where it happened, as well as a \"pop\" sound. At the end you can see that a number of \"place cells\" light up altogether as the animal quickly recalls the route it has just traversed. Morphology of Memory: The Anatomy of the Human Hippocampus \u00b6 The hippocampus is a part of the brain known to be critical for learning and memory. It is made up of many interconnected regions with distinct characteristics. This introductory animation accompanies a web-based, 3D interactive resource teaching the anatomy of the human hippocampus and designed to help graduate students and scientists better understand its 3D structure. Morphology of Memory: The Anatomy of the Human Hippocampus from Alisa Brandt on Vimeo . Sonification of hippocampal ensemble activity during experience \u00b6 Visuals show action potentials (\"spikes\") of ~50 simultaneously recorded neurons from the hippocampus as one of our subjects runs a single trial on a T-maze. Neurons are arranged one per line, according to the order of their peak average firing rate along the track. Average firing fields are shown on the left; note that the neurons arranged at the bottom have firing fields near the left (start), and neurons at the top have firing fields near the right (end).","title":"Science"},{"location":"science/#science","text":"","title":"Science"},{"location":"science/#videos","text":"","title":"Videos"},{"location":"science/#recording_the_activity_of_place_cells_in_a_rat","text":"On the left you can see the activity of 10 hippocampal \"place cells\" as a rat moves from one arm to another in a maze. Each cell's activity is shown with a line next to the cell number and a dot on the track where it happened, as well as a \"pop\" sound. At the end you can see that a number of \"place cells\" light up altogether as the animal quickly recalls the route it has just traversed.","title":"Recording the Activity of \"Place Cells\" in a Rat"},{"location":"science/#morphology_of_memory_the_anatomy_of_the_human_hippocampus","text":"The hippocampus is a part of the brain known to be critical for learning and memory. It is made up of many interconnected regions with distinct characteristics. This introductory animation accompanies a web-based, 3D interactive resource teaching the anatomy of the human hippocampus and designed to help graduate students and scientists better understand its 3D structure.
